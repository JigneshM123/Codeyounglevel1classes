<h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
<p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra,
 Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628â€“1658)
 to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
  The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
   and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
