<h1><center>Browser and Document Object Model</center></h1>
<h2>Browser Object Model</h2>
<br>
<p id = "new">It is used to interact with the browser.
The default object of browser is window means you can call all 
the functions of window by specifying window or directly. 
We can give commands in the console window.
For example:
window.alert(‘CodeYoung’)</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Document Object Model</h2>
<br>
<p>The document object represents the whole html document.
    When html document is loaded in the browser, it becomes a 
    document object. It is the root element that represents the 
    html document. It has properties and methods. By the help 
    of document object, we can add dynamic content to our web
    page.
    We have different types of selectors, like if we have declared 
    any class or id, then with help of DOM we can select them in 
    JS and make it change dynamically.
    For ex-
    ● getElementById() - returns the element having the given id 
    value.</p>

<script>
var a = "Jignesh"
var b = "CodeYoung"
var c = "This is a Codeyoung class in progress"
document.write(" A little boy named "+a+" joined coding classes and their company is called "+b+".")

document.getElementById("new").innerHTML = c
